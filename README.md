## My Process

I developed the project over the course of approximately a month and a half. This is the first project I built after learning React, so I invested a lot of time and effort into researching the technologies I used and their best practices. In order to learn as much as I can from the development of this project, I implemented certain features from scratch including accessible and scrollable tabs, a carousel functionality, and infinite loading.

### Tools

After designing a prototype of the application using Adobe XD, I started developing the app using the following technologies:

- React (Custom hooks & Context API)
- React Router 6
- React Query
- axios
- SCSS modules (CSS grid & CSS Flexbox & Media queries)
- Framer Motion
- Firebase authentication services & Firestore database

In order to search and obtain information about TV shows, I used the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and the [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/).
